{"prompt": "What is the derivative of x^2 with respect to x?", "chosen": "The derivative of x^2 with respect to x is 2x, by the power rule.", "rejected": "The derivative is x."}
{"prompt": "Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 11", "chosen": "Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8. Divide by 2: x = 4.", "rejected": "x is 11."}
{"prompt": "What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads in 3 fair coin flips?", "chosen": "Using the binomial formula: C(3,2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^1 = 3 * 1/8 = 3/8.", "rejected": "1/2."}
{"prompt": "Define the limit of a sequence.", "chosen": "A sequence a_n has limit L if for every epsilon > 0 there exists N such that for all n > N, |a_n - L| < epsilon.", "rejected": "The limit is when n goes to infinity."}
{"prompt": "What is the sum of the first n positive integers?", "chosen": "The sum is n(n+1)/2. This can be shown by induction or by pairing 1 with n, 2 with n-1, etc.", "rejected": "n squared."}
{"prompt": "Explain what a confidence interval is.", "chosen": "A confidence interval is a range of values, computed from sample data, that is likely to contain the true population parameter. A 95% CI means that under repeated sampling, about 95% of such intervals would contain the parameter.", "rejected": "It is the range where the mean lies."}
{"prompt": "What does it mean for a function to be continuous at a point?", "chosen": "A function f is continuous at a point c if (1) f(c) is defined, (2) the limit of f(x) as x approaches c exists, and (3) that limit equals f(c).", "rejected": "The function has no jumps."}
{"prompt": "State the central limit theorem.", "chosen": "Under mild conditions, the sum (or average) of a large number of i.i.d. random variables is approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution.", "rejected": "Samples are normal."}
{"prompt": "What is the rank of a matrix?", "chosen": "The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the column space (or row space), i.e., the maximum number of linearly independent columns (or rows). Equivalently, it is the number of non-zero singular values.", "rejected": "The number of rows."}
{"prompt": "Give the formula for the gradient of a scalar function f(x,y).", "chosen": "The gradient is the vector (partial f/partial x, partial f/partial y), often written as nabla f. It points in the direction of steepest increase.", "rejected": "The derivative of f."}
